        "##  1. Ski Shop -\n",
        "        a. The idea - An all seasons “resort” store. The store will consist of equipment that could either be purchased or rented for use at the nearby resorts. For example, in the winter the store will consist of skis, snowboards, boots, poles, jackets, pants, hats, gloves, etc.  \n",
        "        \n",
        "        b. What makes the idea unique - At our store, not only would there be trained personnel for fitting customers to their equipment, but we also have a year round shop that doesn’t focus on one season/sport. What makes our business unique is the training location around back. The training location will consist of two small slopes for training for both the snow sports and summer sports. Typically when people rent equipment from our store, they are either trying it for the first time, or are trying to make sure they enjoy it before they go out and buy equipment of their own. Either way, there are going to be customers who may need some guidance before they hit the mountain. Of course, there are going to be people who are interested in trying these sports to see if they like them before going out onto the mountain. This option will be available, however, sif the customer does not rent the equipment, they will pay full price to use the training facility. Customers that do end up renting or buying equipment from our store will only pay a small fee for use of the facility. \n",

Our aim is to provide each customer with the item they want, and make the customers happy about their purchase.\n",

The customer plans on going to the ski resort just up the road from the shop, however, they do not have any equipment. Our skilled staff ,with immense knowledge of the equipment, would greet them and ask them what their needs/wants are. From there the staff member would fit them with the proper equipment based off of their height/weight, skill level, and style. The customer would then try on all of the equipment and fill out all necessary forms. If a training session is needed or they want to try out the equipment before they spend the money on it, they are free to use the facility in the back. The customer will then take their equipment and head to the mountain. Customer will return the items within 24 hours, either during store hours, or on the designated bins when the store is closed. \n",

        "## 2. Housing Options -\n",
        "        On campus housing options is one of our ideas. We will have four tables that include the location of the building, age of the building, type of housing, and who they would like to live with, if anyone. The location of the building could be in North, South, East, or West. The age of the building would provide students with the option to live in renovated or unrenovated. The type of housing could be single, double, quad, or supplemental. Lastly, the student would be able to select whether they will have a roommate, a specific person they have chosen, or a random person before they submit their request. We will use the last table to collect customer preferences. \n",
        "        \n",
        "        I think this idea is unique because it is one that everyone is familiar with since most students in this classroom have experienced all of the different types of housing options on campus. This will make it easier to understand when our fellow classmates are looking at it. In addition, I know it is sometimes hard to see all of the different options when looking through Penn State's database. This idea may be able to provide some useful, real world clarity. This product is not brand new, it is borrowed from Penn State University. A typical business interaction would usually only happen once or twice a year. Students would apply to live in Penn State housing. \n",
        "        \n",
        "        They would then make the choice of which location they would prefer. They would then choose the age of the building they would like to live in and the type of housing they would like. Their final choice would be who they want to live with if anyone. At the end, they would have their housing option preferences. The goal for this project is to figure out which housing option is most popular. This data can be used when building new dorms around campus. I will use the location of the building, the age of the building, and the type of the building to answer this question.\n"
