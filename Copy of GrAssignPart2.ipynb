Ski Shop -\n","\n","    a. The idea - An all seasons “resort” store. The store will consist of equipment that could either be purchased or rented for use at the nearby resorts. For example, in the winter the store will consist of skis, snowboards, boots, poles, jackets, pants, hats, gloves, etc.  \n"," \n","    b. What makes the idea unique - At our store, not only would there be trained personnel for fitting customers to their equipment, but we also have a year round shop that doesn’t focus on one season/sport. What makes our business unique is the training location around back. The training location will consist of two small slopes for training for both the snow sports and summer sports. Typically when people rent equipment from our store, they are either trying it for the first time, or are trying to make sure they enjoy it before they go out and buy equipment of their own. Either way, there are going to be customers who may need some guidance before they hit the mountain. Of course, there are going to be people who are interested in trying these sports to see if they like them before going out onto the mountain. This option will be available, however, sif the customer does not rent the equipment, they will pay full price to use the training facility. Customers that do end up renting or buying equipment from our store will only pay a small fee for use of the facility. \n"," \n","    c.Brand-new or borrowed - Borrowed but with a twist. Our ski shop is an enhanced version of a normal retail shop aiming to provide customers with more ways to choose the product and they want, our service staff will guide customers step by step to know their needs. Our aim is to provide each customer with the item they want, and make the customers happy about their purchase.\n"," \n","    d. A typical Day in the business - For example, a customer comes in the store in the winter time. The customer plans on going to the ski resort just up the road from the shop, however, they do not have any equipment. Our skilled staff ,with immense knowledge of the equipment, would greet them and ask them what their needs/wants are. From there the staff member would fit them with the proper equipment based off of their height/weight, skill level, and style. The customer would then try on all of the equipment and fill out all necessary forms. If a training session is needed or they want to try out the equipment before they spend the money on it, they are free to use the facility in the back. The customer will then take their equipment and head to the mountain. Customer will return the items within 24 hours, either during store hours, or on the designated bins when the store is closed. \n"," \n","    e. Entities/Attributes - Entities will include, snowboards, skis, boots for both of those, hats, gloves, jackets, pants, socks, mountain bikes, street bikes, bike parts, bike gloves. Attributes will include different specifications of each of the entities, such as: weight, durability, binding types, weather resistance, etc. Our staff will also be counted as a attribute to our customers because their service and how professional they act will directly impact our customer's experience.\n","    Table 1 - Pricing lists (Listing entities and their respecive prices)\n","    Table 2 - Types of products (Listing various type of products we have)\n","    Table 3 - List of customers and the time it has passed since they borrowed the equipment.\n","    Table 4 - Training yard availability\n","    Table 5 - Best selling products.\n","    \n","    \n","The idea we went with is our All Seasons Resort Store.
